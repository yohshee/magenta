<p class="title">Status Window</p>
<p>The Magenta Status Window, accessed by using <strong>Tools -&gt; Status Window</strong>, is just another way of looking at your user lists.</p>
<p>Cyan employees, Cyan guests, and regular chatters are all shown in this window, and are discerned by differences in their icon appearance (e.g. the Cyan employee icons all wear cyan-colored shirts). Hovering your mouse pointer over an icon will give you a little information about the user, in particular their mangled IP address.</p>
<p>You can change how the list view is shown by going to the <strong>View</strong> menu, and selecting either <strong>Large Icons</strong> or <strong>Report</strong>. The report view will display the mangled IP address, along with the user name.</p>
<p>The <strong>File</strong> menu allows you to either <strong>Close</strong> the status window, or <strong>Save</strong> a file containing all of the users and their associated information. This file has an extension of <em>.log</em>, and is formatted using the Windows INI format.</p>
<p>Selecting <strong>Log All Incoming Packets</strong> will prompt you for a filename, and, following that, it will log all usernames every time the Chat Server sends a who list update.</p>
