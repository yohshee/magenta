<p>The Block List feature of Magenta is a way to ignore people that you know that are going to cause problems without having to ignore them each time you enter the chat room. Unlike the standard Ignore feature, however, the Block List operates on name recognition, rather than mangled IP address recognition, and is entirely maintained by Magenta rather than the chat server.</p>
<p>Also, instead of vanishing entirely from the <strong>Who is Online</strong> list, people in the Block List appear embellished with the string &quot;[Blocked]&quot; after their name.</p>
<p>Access your Block List by going to <strong>Chat -&gt; Block List</strong>. To add a name, type it in the <strong>Name to add</strong> text box, and click <strong>Add Name</strong>.  To remove one from the list, simply select it from the list, and click <strong>Remove Name</strong>.</p>
<p>To save your changes to the block list and close the dialog box, click <strong>Save and Close</strong>. To close the dialog box without saving, click <strong>Discard Changes</strong>.</p>
