<p class="title">Raw Command Console</p>
<p>The Raw Command Console (RCC), accessed by selecting <strong>Tools -&gt; Send Raw Command</strong>, is for advanced users ONLY.</p>
<p>It allows you to send a command, with no validation at all except for the addition of a carriage return-linefeed character at the end, directly to the chat server. This is useful for, say, changing your name without leaving the chat to do so. (Note that changing your name in this way, though, will not change your name in the Your Name text box, nor will any Magenta-specific niftiness dealing with your name be applied to it.  Use <strong>Chat -&gt;
 Switch Name</strong> to switch names, instead.)</p>
<p>No lists of valid commands are provided in this help file; for that, go visit the <a href="http://cho.cyan.com/chat" target="_BLANK">official Cyan Chat pages</a>. They are under the CC Programmers section. If you are feeling masochistic, you can download Magenta's source code and learn the protocol that way, but I don't recommend it.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color:red">WARNING:</span></em></strong> Mistyping any CC command can result in your getting banned from the chat for a day. If you are banned, well, it's not my fault. You shouldn't have been messing with the RCC. You may also note that this warning is repeated in the RCC dialog box, and for good reason.</p>
