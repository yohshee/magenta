<p class="title">Ignoring Users</p>
<p>There comes a time when you find someone being obnoxious or troll-like. Instead of talking back to them and <em>encouraging</em> them, why not take advantage of something that's built into Cyan Chat to deter them?</p>
<p>That is, <em>ignore them</em>.</p>
<p>It's easy, and restricted only to those in the <strong>Who is Online</strong> list: Select a name, and click the <strong>Ignore</strong> button. They'll vanish from the user list.  There. Problem solved. You don't even have to be logged into chat to do it, either. If they're using a client that implemented the Ignore protocol correctly, they'll ignore you in return. This is what is known as "Mutual Ignore." They are also blocked by IP address, so that if they try to come in under a different name, they will still be ignored.</p>
<p>If you are ignored by a user, by default, Magenta notifies you by a message in the main window. Get enough of these messages, and you might want to rethink what you're doing in the chat room.</p>
<p>If you find that you ignored someone by accident, don't panic and don't close Magenta. Even though they probably mutually ignored you, you can still get them back. Go to <strong>Chat -&gt; Show Ignored</strong>. This will show you all of those whom you have ignored, along with their mangled IP addresses and an indicator telling you if they're still connected to the chat room or not. To unignore someone, simply select their name from the list, and click <strong>Unignore</strong>. Simple.</p>
