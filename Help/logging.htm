<p class="title">Logging in Magenta</p>
<p>In Magenta, there are a couple of ways that you can log a chat: via the Snapshot method, or the Memory-based method.</p>

<p>All previous versions of Magenta allowed you to take snapshots of the current chat and save them in RTF or text (though, granted, it didn't always work as expected). Memory-based is new. Both are explained in the following help topics.</p>
