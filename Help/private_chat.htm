<p class="title">Private Chat</p>
<p>Private chat utilizing the main chat window is very similar to regular chatting in nearly every way; every option that was mentioned in the <a href="public_chat.htm">public chat</a> section applies to private chat when using the main window. The only difference is that you select a user from either list box and click <strong>Send Private</strong> to send your message.</p>
<p>It's when you start using the private chat windows that things get interesting.</p>
<p>To open a private chat window, select a user from either list box, and click the <strong>Private Chat</strong> button. Any private message from this person will now be dispatched to this window.</p>
<p>To send messages, type your message in the bottom text box and hit Enter, or click the <strong>Send</strong> button. All private chat window messages are timestamped as they appear.</p>
<p>Closing the chat session is done by simply clicking <strong>Close</strong>. You can save a plain-text log of the session, as well, by clicking <strong>Save Log</strong>.</p>
