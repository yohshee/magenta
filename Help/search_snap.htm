<p class="title">Search Snapshot</p>

<p>One tool that Magenta has to make your life easier is contained at <strong>Tools -> Search Snapshot</strong>. This allows you to search through a current snapshot of the chat session for something someone may have said, a mangled IP, or anything else that you may need to search for.</p>

<p>Of course, you may be wondering why you search a snapshot instead of the actual chat window, bringing up a new interface in the process. This is to prevent any sort of disruption as the window is updating due to new messages from the server. For instance, you just searched for someone's name, and then the window updates. Well, you just lost it, and you'll have to search again, right? Right.</p>

<p>The window is easy to operate. The snapshot appears in the top text box; click in this text box to position the insertion point where you want to begin your search.  Type in the search string at the prompt, and click <strong>Search</strong>. If found, the text will be highlighted.  You can then click <strong>Search</strong> as many times as you like to find other instances of the search string.</p>

<p>If the text was not found, or you run out of matches, you'll be told so. Click <strong>Close</strong> to exit.</p>
