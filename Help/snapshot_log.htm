<p class="title">Snapshot Logs</p>

<p>Snapshot logs are a way to take a quick &quot;picture&quot; of the current state of the chat buffer and save it to a file.</p>
<p>In other words, it just grabs all of the text you've received so far, without making a single change to it, and stuffs it into a file. No biggy. Saving the file as Rich Text will preserve any formatting, such as color.</p>
<p>To save a snapshot log, all you have to do is select <strong>Chat -&gt; Save Snapshot Log</strong>, select whether you want to save it as Rich Text Format (RTF) or text (saving it as text allows you to choose either the extension <em>.log</em> or <em>.txt</em>), and enter the filename. Simple.</p>
