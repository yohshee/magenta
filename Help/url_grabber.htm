<p class="title">URL Grabber</p>

<p>Ever been chatting and realize you wanted to check that link that someone mentioned about an hour ago, and you don't feel like digging through hundreds of lines of scrollback just to get to it?</p>

<p>No problem. That's why Magenta has an URL grabber.</p>

<p>What this does is that as you chat, each time an URL pops up in conversation, Magenta snatches it and stores it away for you without your having to think about it. Handy, huh? Of course, the URL list is wiped out once you close the program. That and URLs with spaces won't work correctly.  URLs shouldn't have spaces, anyway.</p>

<p>To view the list of URLs that have been grabbed, simply go to <strong>Tools -> URL Grabber</strong>. Select one and click <strong>Go to Link</strong> to bring it up in your default browser window. You can double-click the URL in the list, too, to do the same thing. Click <strong>Close</strong> to exit.</p>
