<p>The crash reporting feature of Magenta allows you to send, upon abnormal shutdown of the program, a report detailing the current state of the program to the program author.</p>
<p>To use this feature, check off <strong>Enable automatic crash reporting</strong> and fill in the fields. <strong>Return e-mail address</strong> is your address, and the <strong>SMTP server</strong> is found by checking your email settings, if you have a POP3 mailbox. If you don't, you cannot use the crash reporting feature.</p>
