<p class="title">Welcome to Magenta</p>
<p>Magenta is a Cyan Chat client that implements version 1 of the CC Protocol. It implements it completely and correctly, providing full ignore and color support.  It's also very small, in some respects, and requires no support files except those that come with Windows.</p>
<p>This help file, if you chose to download it along with Magenta, is completely separate. If you want to access it from within Magenta, though, be sure to put it in the same directory as the program itself. Viewing the help is done as with any program, simply go to <strong>Help -&gt; Help Topics</strong></p>
<p>Magenta contains quite a few features, both cosmetic and useful, and this help file can help you get the most out of them. Note that some of them may be exclusive to Windows 2000/XP.</p>

<p>And don't forget you can always check out the latest version of Magenta, news on the next version, or bug fixes at the <a href="http://www.fadedtwilight.org/Magenta" target="_BLANK">website.</a> If you want, you can also get old versions of Magenta here, as well as the associated source code.</p>
