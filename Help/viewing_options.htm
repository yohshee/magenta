<p class="title">Viewing Options</p>
<p>Viewing options control how you visualize what's going on with the program.</p>
<p>One of these, obviously, is found by using <strong>Tools -&gt; Font</strong>. This allows you to set all of the font options for the main message area of Magenta. In order for the font to change, however, the current contents of the chat area must be cleared. Keep this in mind, and if there's anything you want to save, save it before you clear out the area. Memory-based logs are unaffected by clearing the chat area.</p>
<p><strong>Tools -&gt Opacity</strong> is <em>only</em> available on Windows 2000/XP; if you are using an earlier operating system, this menu item will be disabled. It allows you to change the percentage of opacity of the window. Be forewarned that it takes additional processing to render a transparent window, so things may slow down when you change it, if you have an older computer.</p>
