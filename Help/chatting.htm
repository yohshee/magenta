<p class="title">Chatting</p>
<p>There's not much different between chatting with Magenta and chatting with the regular Cyan Chat client.</p>
<p>You follow the same steps regardless of which client you use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the chat client.</li>
<li>Establish a connection to the chat server (this is always done automatically by the Java client, and by default done automatically by Magenta)</li>
<li>Choose a name for yourself, minding the rules. Both clients enforce them.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Join Chat</strong> button, and start chatting.</li>
<li>Once you're finished chatting, click the <strong>Leave Chat</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both clients allow you to send and receive private messages, as well, but Magenta gives you the option of using <em>private message windows</em> to isolate private messages from the main chatting area, and to help you stay a bit more organized when chatting.</p>
<p>Also, there are some fan-maintained CC servers out there and a special chat server, and in your preferences, you can change where you connect. Connecting to a server is easy, once the settings are configured: just go to <strong>Chat -&gt; Connect</strong>. If there are any errors, they will be displayed in the status bar. Disconnecting is done by selecting <strong>Disconnect</strong> in that same menu.</p>
<p>The following pages give some more details. For information on changing connection options, see the <a href="login_options.htm">Login Options</a> section.</p>
